      	<h1>Testimonials</h1> 
      	<blockquote>I found Rocket City Sitters after issues with my nanny led me to begin a new search on short notice. I found them responsible, dependable, and trustworthy. After my in-laws, they are next on the list for all my short-term childcare needs.</blockquote>
		<p>Tracy S. of Madison, mother of three</p>
      	
      	<blockquote>I have been very pleased with the quality of sitters provided to me by Rocket City Sitters. The sitter that has come to my home has been on time, dependable, and most importantly, great with my children. Thank you Rocket City Sitters!</blockquote>
		<p>Amy H. of Huntsville, mother of two</p>

		<blockquote>Thank you for the wonderful service last night. My children really enjoyed Erica and I was so pleased that she actually cleaned up behind herself. I usually have a sink full of dirty dishes when I arrive back home. I will be happy to use you again and to refer you to others.</blockquote>
		<p>Lori T. of Madison, mother of two</p>
		
		<blockquote>Thank you for fulfilling your promises to have qualified and caring employees. The professionalism and yet personal touch of your company is AMAZING!
			<br /><br />Courtney, a single Mom, was exceptionally pleased. Her family member ditched her babysitting commitment at the last-minute. She called you guys at approximately 6 pm. You took care of it within 15 minutes! She is a protective mother who rarely gets the chance to go out for a while without worrying about her 2 year old son.  The qualified sitter, Kalyn, was PERFECT. She alleviated any fears Courtney had prior to leaving and answered her call just to check on Connor as well was being awake and alert at approximately 3 am when Courtney got home. The price was fair and documented.
			<br /><br />I will recommend your professional services often. Thank you again!!!

		<p>Tony S. of Huntsville, grandfather of one</p>
		
		<blockquote>I am SO pleased with Janibell! She is personable, punctual, and totally engaged my child with consideration for his unique personality. I also appreciated her cleaning up my son's toys at the end of the night.
			<br /><br />I am impressed with the professionalism and promptness of Rocket City Sitters. Thank you for meeting this need in Huntsville!

		<p>Shannon W. of Huntsville, mother of two</p>
		
		<blockquote>I just wanted to let you know that Kalyn was wonderful last night! My son had a great time and we had a worry free evening Thanks so much, and the next time we need a sitter we will definitely call!!
We look forward to using her again.

		<blockquote>Thanks so much for providing Kimberly to help out with Evan and Lexi this weekend. We had an absolute blast at my reunion and Kimberly’s help made it possible! Please tell her how much we enjoyed her kind, patient and fun assistance! Evan really liked her and we did, too!</blockquote>
    <p>Angela M. of Marietta, Georgia, mother of two</p>
    
    <blockquote>I'd like to express my utmost thanks.  Carmen watched our boys and was so pleasant.  I was shocked to find that when I was getting ready to leave, my son actually got the door for me and said goodbye.  My boys are never that willing to let me out of their sight - it was something to laugh about.  They even asked if she was going to church with us last night!   I will definitely use your service again and hope Carmen is available to come back when I need her.  Thank you so much.</blockquote>
    <p>Linda D. of Huntsville, mother of three</p>
    
    <blockquote>I feel so fortunate to have found reliable, trustworthy, loving childcare with Rocket City Sitters. My family and I recently separated from the Air Force and are still new to Huntsville, and currently all our family live hours away. When I first researched a babysitter for the occasional date night and after looking through dozens of sitters, I was left feeling anxious and overwhelmed that I wouldn't find anyone that led up to my expectations of childcare for my two small children. But when I discovered Rocket City Sitters, I reviewed their qualifications for sitters and read the testimonials; I was so at ease and decided to give them a try. I was impressed that each sitter has CPR certification, and background checks.  I loved that I was able to set up an initial interview with the sitter, too. It gave me a chance to meet with her and see how she responded to my children. 
      <br /><br />Kalyn is wonderful! She is punctual, respectful to my family and our home, very engaged with my two small children. She even had my children's toys picked up, and was alert when my husband and I got home at 10:30 pm. My oldest, Ava keeps asking when "Her friend will be coming over to play again." That was enough for me; I knew we had found someone great! I recommend Rocket City sitters to everyone I know!
