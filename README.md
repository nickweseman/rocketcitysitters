# Rocket City Sitters

Website code was written for the Rocket City Sitters business out of Huntsville, AL.  It was used from 2009 to 2012.
Website is written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Installation Instructions:
# PHP
You can view the code without a web server, by running straight php:

php.exe index.php > index.html

... do this for each file

Then open index.html in your browser.

# LAMP / WAMP
For a more holistic solution, I would suggest to install either:
LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
or
WAMP - Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP
on your local machine and use that to serve up the php webpages.
