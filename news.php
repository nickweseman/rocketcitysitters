        <h2>Rocket City Sitters Gives Huntsville Parents a Reliable Way to Find a Qualified Babysitter</h2>
        <p>October 29, 2009</p>
	      <p><strong>Rocket City Sitters announces its grand opening, finally giving parents in the Huntsville/Madison County area a quick, reliable way to gain access to professional babysitters.  Parents can call one phone number and have instant access to an experienced, certified babysitter, even on short notice.</strong></p>
	      <p>Rocket City Sitters now makes busy parents’ lives easier by providing access to short-term childcare from professional, certified sitters.  No more scrambling to get the neighborhood kid down the street, burdening friends and family, or agonizing over daycare hours.</p>     
	      <p>“Rocket City Sitters was established to bring together qualified sitters and families needing short-term childcare in Huntsville, Madison County and surrounding areas,” says owner Adrienne Stephens.  “We’ve gone the extra mile to make sure parents get only the best sitters, all of whom have proper certification and experience.” </p>
	      <p>Unlike a typical neighborhood babysitter, Rocket City Sitters are at least 18 years old, have at least two years of extensive childcare experience, are Infant & Child CPR and First Aid certified, and have passed a thorough background check, reference check, and in-person interview. </p>
	      <p>Whenever a family needs short-term childcare, they just call Rocket City Sitters.  “Whether it’s running errands, going to dinner and a movie, or attending a last-minute event, Rocket City Sitters can provide a sitter to fit parents’ needs.”  Sitters can be requested for as little as two hours or as long as an entire day.  </p>
	      <p>“The concept isn’t new, just new to Huntsville. We brought this service over from a company in Austin, Texas that has been successful in helping families find qualified sitters since 1986. We’ve adapted it to fit the needs of Huntsville area families,” says owner Erica Weseman. </p>
	      <p>Parents should call Rocket City Sitters at (256) 272-1727 or visit the website at <a href="http://www.rocketcitysitters.com" target="_blank">www.RocketCitySitters.com</a> to get started by filling out a family information form. </p>
	      <p>Look for Rocket City Sitters in the community this Halloween.  Members are participating in several events throughout the Huntsville/Madison County area.  Sitters and owners will be on-hand to answer any questions that parents have about the process.  </p>
	      <p>Rocket City Sitters will be at the Y.M.C.A. Trunk-or-Treat on Friday October 30, from 5:45 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Rocket City Sitters will host games and award prizes to all who participate.  Other events, including a cookie walk, moon bounce, and hay ride, will also be available.  The Southeast Family Y.M.C.A. is located at 1000 Weatherly Road in Huntsville. </p>
	      <p>Rocket City Sitters will also be at the Lake Guntersville State Park Trunk-or-Treat on Saturday October 31, starting at 5:00 p.m.  Along with Rocket City Sitters games and prizes, other events include a haunted hayride through the King’s Chapel Cemetery and a bonfire.  Lake Guntersville State Park is located at 7966 Alabama Highway 227 in Guntersville. </p>
	      <p>Admission to both events is free, and children of all ages are welcome. </p>
